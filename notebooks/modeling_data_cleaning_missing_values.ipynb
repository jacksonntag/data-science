To build on the \"data as the new oil\" analogy presented above, we can think of the data cleaning process as similar to refining oil. \n","\n","We don't use crude oil in our automobiles, but instead oil that has been processed and refined. This process eliminates harmful elements found in crude oil and transforms it into something suitable for our cars. \"Dirty\" data can indeed poison our models just how crude oil would damage the engines of our cars! This risk explains why data scientists spend so much time exploring and cleaning data. \n","\n","As a \"byproduct\" of our \"data refining\" process, we also come to know the data better.

It appears from the output as if our dataset contains no missing values, but we know from our exploration in the last checkpoint that this is not the case. \n","\n","This discrepancy arises in how `.isnull()` counts a \"missing\" record. The record has to be truly *blank* to be flagged as `True`. In our dataset, missing values are represented with two dashes (`--`) rather than left as truly blank. \n","\n","This is a common scenario with real-world datasets, so the question emerges: **How do we find missing values, when they might not be left blank**? Unfortunately, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" answer to this question.

This data frame will likely produce a reasonable, if slightly cumbersome, list of unique values to visually inspect. However, if we had 5 *million* observations, it might be infeasible to visually inspect what is wrong with the values.\n","\n","In the previous checkpoint, we saw that Pandas provides us the  `.nunique()` function on data frames to get the *count* of the unique values in each column.

However, if we still have abundant data points even after removing these records, this might be the safest approach to take. If you're dealing in the tens of thousands of records, for example, and fewer than a dozen are missing, continue with the analysis. It should also be mentioned that sometimes filling in the missing values (see next step) alters the results of our analysis, and we're better off excluding them entirely.  \n","\n","2. **Filling the missing values with some unharmful values**: This is generally the preferred and more common approach in dealing with missing values for data science.

The basic idea here is to populate missing values using the values of non-missing values in similar rows. For example, if we have one missing value, we could take the average of the two closest neighbors of this value's row and assign that value in place of the missing one. There are several interpolation techniques such as *linear*, *quadratic*, *cubic* and so forth.

If we expect continuity in a variable that evolves over time, then we can use interpolation to make use of that continuity. In this sense, interpolation requires a meaningful ordering of the observations and a trend in the ordered data. Because of these unique conditions, you should be careful in applying interpolation to non-ordered data as it may lead to erronous values. You can find more information on interpolation on this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation).\n","\n","Applying interpolation is quite easy with Pandas' `.interpolate()` function.
