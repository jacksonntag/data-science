<p>The Everyday Sexism Project exists to catalogue instances of sexism experienced on a day to day basis. They might be serious or minor, outrageously offensive or so niggling and normalised that you don’t even feel able to protest. Say as much or as little as you like, use your real name or a pseudonym – it’s up to you. By sharing your story you’re showing the world that sexism does exist, it is faced by women everyday and it is a valid problem to discuss.
</p><p>
If you prefer to e-mail me at laura@everydaysexism.com I can upload your story for you instead. Follow us on Twitter (and submit entries by tweet) at @EverydaySexism.

<p>(This is part-vent, as I am quite angry right now.) Working as the only female in a male-orientated team/traditional work culture.  Just had a meeting where someone used a variation of the &#8220;don&#8217;t worry your little head about it &#8211; your job is to make the tea&#8221; &#8216;Games People Play&#8217; ploy, when I raised a legitimate question arising from my role. No use escalating &#8211; my boss, who is male and also on these calls,  talks to me reasonably off-call and &#8216;gangs up with the boys&#8217; and is routinely  passive aggressive/ hugely patronising during the calls. On last Friday&#8217;s team call, his response to a process query was to explain, in painstaking detail, how to prioritise e-mails. I am a highly-qualified and experienced manager of 55.<br />
It is not safe to mention potential sexism or raise complaints and grievances in this culture as it brands you a trouble-maker and generates further openly-expressed or covert negative assumptions and decisions. There is lots of talk about how to get more women into the profession, which is worthwhile to consider, but this can only be a &#8216;band-aid over a gaping wound&#8217; and many women will leave if the underlying debilitating everyday sexism in all corporate cultures continues to remain unacknowledged and unaddressed.</p>

<p>I was on the BBC web site looking at the news and I found an article about mental health and acute crisis. In the video it said that patients should have better access to talking therapies, psychiarists and psychiatric nurses. Because the patient who was talking probably didn&#8217;t want to be identified, drawings were used to depict what she was saying. They depicted the psychiatrist as a man and the nurse as a woman and I fealt that the BBC was using gender role stereotypes.</p>

<p>My husband said I should forget about the fact that my 30 year old son had just thrown a wooden spoon at me which hit me and had also threatened to kill me with a knife and had had to be restrained by my husband whilst screaming at me about how much he hates me and how useless I am. All this because I refused to help him empty the dishwasher and told him that it was his turn as I do it every day.<br />
My husband said that it didn&#8217;t matter because my son only flips out every few months and he&#8217;s calmed down now.  I guess it&#8217;s just another thing I need to suck up.<br />
That&#8217;s life living with misogynists.</p>

<p>&#8211; Getting catcalled in front of a graveyard where I visited my grandpa&#8217;s grave when I was about twelve. I looked some years older than I was, but still no reason for a man who is well in his thirties to call after me from his car. First I didn&#8217;t realize what had happened, because I thought he might know my family and just wanted to say hello, but when I described him to my parents, they didn&#8217;t know him. They were both astonished and enraged that this happened to me at such a young age.</p>
<p>&#8211; Getting stared at by a teacher in class for an hour staight on wearing a light summer dress with some cleavage. I was about 15 then and clearly showed my discomfort by holding my arms in front of my breasts, which he joked at. Luckily, my parents took good care of that asshole&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Continuously getting lectured about the basics of sailing by several younger boys who had just started to sail some time ago. I was 15 to 16 and had been leading the sailing club for 3 years. So I challenged them for a race and won against all of them using the shittiest boat we had. Some of them learned their lesson and become good friends of mine when we were older.</p>
<p>&#8211; Being offerd 50€ by a customer for sex behind a beergarden I worked at. This was right after I finished school and I was 19. He was at least 70 and had been visiting the place regularly for decades. His poor wife was standing nearby, had to hear everything he said. She later came back to apologize for his behavior and asked me not to tell anyone. I told her, it wasn&#8217;t her fault and that I felt sorry for her. Anyway, I told a female collegue, who was a little older than me, about what had happened. She yelled at the guy who answered her in a very arrogant manner, indicating that such behavior had worked out well for him in the past. We proceeded to tell our boss who kicked him out of the place for good, even though this old asshole insisted I was making things up. Knowing him for quite some time though, my colleagues found my story quite plausible&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Beeing laughed at by an adult man on telling the above mentioned story about the beergarden during a discussion about sexism. He obviously found this old guy hilarous and somewhat adorable.</p>
<p>&#8211; Being bullied by my new boyfriend&#8217;s group of friends, because they thought he hadn&#8217;t waited long enough to meet me after his last relationship. Apparently, this made ME a slut&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Having to lead a serious discussion with an IT-student, who thought that women can&#8217;t be good programmers because he only knew one such woman. This was obviously due to the fact, that he hardly knew ANY women, most of which didn&#8217;t happen to be programmers at all&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Overhearing a good friend of my boyfriend telling a guy at a party that I clearly wanted to fuck him. I told this to my boyfriend. He was totally struck by it and his friend denied what he had said. This gave a huge blow to my relationship.</p>
<p>&#8211; Constantly beeing asked if I understood the mathmatical operations and the programming I had done MYSELF for a university project. The female(!) research assistant we worked with, naturally assumed, that my boyfrind (who also was part of the group) had done that part of the project &#8220;and she just wanted to make shure, that everyone had put the same effort into it&#8221;. However I got all the credit for a final poster we made, because it had a pinkish background-colour. At that point I asked her, how she got to the assessment, that this was my own personal colour choice, as we had just chosen it quite randomly because the colour scheme had a funny name. She then referred to me as a &#8220;pink type of woman&#8221; because I wore purple nail-polish. She herself tended to dress rather androgynous. Apparently, looking to &#8220;female&#8221; made me less competent in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8211; Beeing offerd 20 € for sex by a foreigner in the streets while walking home at night just some weeks ago.</p>
<p>&#8211; Beeing asked for my number and a date by a man who claimed he knew me in the streets at brought daylight. He followed me for 100m and was really annoying. When I made clear, that he could not follow me any further, he tried to make me kiss his cheek. I got rid of him, told him that he had crossed the line and left. I later felt bad because I was not harsh enough at this instant because I was not prepared for it at all&#8230;This also happend recently.</p>
<p>&#8211; Getting asked by other sailors if they could talk to the skipper of my ship, when there were no plausible reason for me to deal with them in the first place except for the fact that I WAS the skipper&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8211; Getting told once a month that I actually count as a guy because I am good at maths and do certain types of sport. I guess not counting as a woman makes me less of a threat to guys who are insecure about their own struggle with maths or sports&#8230;? Whatever the reasons for this, I still find it totally rude not to acknowledge my (very obviously recognizable) gender.</p>
<p>I am writing this down today because I am feeling extremely insecure about an appointment I have tomorrow. I have to ask a tutor a question about programming (an activity I only do on a very unregular basis, because I am actually working on a totally unrelated Master&#8217;s degree) and I feel really afraid, that he might be condescending and judge my for not already knowing everything about it. Most probably he will just be a decent guy and give me the answer I need. It is those bad experiences that make me worry: To be taken seriously as woman you feel like you need to be three steps ahead of the guys you are being compared to. (Maybe four steps if you are small, blond and feminine-looking as I am.) And you need to be strong and react promplty when being harassed. Because failing to react makes it even worse. It makes you feel stupid and week. I encourage every woman to clearly state their experiences with sexism. Some of the above examples show that talking to a parent, a colleague or a friend can actually bring about some justice. Stick to your point firmly and clearly articulate your discomfort! Don&#8217;t be afraid to show the weakness you are feeling! It is a natural reaction and all the decent people will understand you!<br />
I also want to thank all men who are sensible towards women&#8217;s issues.<br />
Finally I want to shout out to all women who discriminate against other women or who feel superior for not being &#8220;typical women&#8221;: Fuck you! You are the worst!</p>

<p>A nice bit of casual sexism on James Martin&#8217;s Food Map of Britain on the Good Food channel just now:</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve yet to meet an Irishman who doesn&#8217;t love his spuds&#8217; (or words to that effect). So only Irishmen eat potatoes then, Mr Martin? Dude, I think you&#8217;ll find you mean that you&#8217;ve yet to meet an Irish PERSON who doesn&#8217;t love THEIR spuds!</p>

<p>I was watching an old episode of 999 on YouTube recently, where a British guy got stung by a swarm of bees. As part of this segment, a guy who was an expert (I think he was a lecturer) in beekeeping featured in the show, talking about bees &amp; beekeeping. He used the male pronoun to talk about beekeepers- because of course only men can be beekeepers! I&#8217;m sure there are quite a few female beekeepers out there!</p>

<p>It was my freshman year of college, and I&#8217;d been dating this guy for about four or five months.  We were laying in bed in my dorm and he started to put his hand down my pants.  I told him that I wasn&#8217;t in the mood, but he kept going anyways, saying things like, &#8220;Oh come on, it&#8217;s not like you have to do anything,&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with you?&#8221;  I didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I did nothing.  I started crying, quietly at first so he wouldn&#8217;t hear me, but soon it became loud and uncontrollable sobbing.  Only then did he stop.  But when he stopped, he didn&#8217;t apologize, he didn&#8217;t wipe my tears&#8230;  He just said &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that you&#8217;re not into this,&#8221; and turned over in bed.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until several years later that I realized that I had been violated.  Until quite recently, I had thought that entire situation was my fault and that he had the right to be angry with me.  This is why sexism needs to stop.  It needs to stop so that the next girl who gets violated by her boyfriend knows that it&#8217;s not her fault.</p>
