As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn\u2019t quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager.

Um no, jealousy is NOT a sign of love, & it isn\u2019t a compliment either! It\u2019s a sign of control! I\u2019ve heard about several cases where women have been stalked and/or murdered by jealous ex (male) partners who\u2019ve taken the view that if they can\u2019t have their exes, no one can. What I also find annoying is the fact that women are always portrayed as \u2018bunny-boilers\u2019 who take being spurned badly (the old adage \u2018hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\u2019 springs to mind), yet I\u2019ve heard about far more men who behave like this than women."]},

Anyway, I was travelling through the jungle last summer as part of a community project in Belize and I started to get very close to a Danish guy. As I had been away for a long time I had not been able to shave regularly. When we finally got naked, he took one look at me and pushed me away. He said all manner of horrible things to me and then told all the other guys on the project that I looked like a monkey. I now have serious emotional issues and do not know what to do."]}
