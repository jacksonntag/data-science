In this checkpoint, you'll complete the SQL self-sufficiency exam. The point of this exam is to demonstrate your mastery of basic SQL skills. The exam is designed to have you generate some realistic SQL queries you might need to do in your everyday life as a data scientist.

To complete this exam, you should either submit a link to a Gist file with your answers or else paste your answers directly into the submission UI. You can indicate which question the query is for by using a code comment like this:

```SQL
-- 1

SELECT....

-- 2

SELECT....
```

Your answers to each prompt will be evaluated on two criteria. First, the grader will look to see that you have created the correct query. For each of the prompts below, there is a single, correct answer. Second, the grader will look at how you've styled your queries. They'll look to see that you're following the recommended style guidelines for this program (especially around capitalizing SQL keywords and using lowercase for table and field names, as well as using multiple lines to make your queries more readable).


## Connect to the database

To complete this exam, you'll need to connect to a remote database server. Here are the credentials:

Host: 142.93.121.174

For this exam, you'll need to use the *customers-products-transactions* database.


## Query prompts

Below you'll find 9 numbered prompts that will require you to write SQL queries. These prompts are split up into two distinct sections focusing on data exploration and data analysis.


1. Create a query that returns the name of the most popular item in every state and the state. 
2. Create a query that returns the name and purchase amount of the five customers in each state who have spent the most money. 
3. Create a query that returns the five most popular items for users with a ‘gmail’ email in the past 30 days, based on number of sales.
