## Overview and Purpose

We know how excited you are to begin moving toward your new career! In this checkpoint, we’ll explore the broad scope of the tech community, introduce you to tech-specific websites and resources, highlight the types of roles that exist in Data Science, touch on the job market, and pinpoint some of the best ways to proactively engage with the technical landscape. 

## Objectives

By the end of this checkpoint, you will:

- Gain knowledge of the job outlook in the tech space
- Be able to explore possible jobs, companies, and industries
- Know how to stay abreast of technology trends and news 
- Create a preliminary list of potential companies to work for

## The Tech Job Outlook

**Demand is high**

According to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm), employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from now through 2026.  13% might not sound like a lot, but that’s faster than any other occupation.  

While the demand for more tech hires is great news for you, it doesn’t mean that it will be easy. Your future job search and success will depend a lot on the work that you do leading up to your search. We want to be proactive in helping you gain a better understanding of the inner-workings of your new field. This includes keeping a pulse on where the field is experiencing the most growth, having knowledge of how to seek opportunities, how to make yourself stand out to employers.

**Salaries**

In addition to being knowledgeable about finding opportunities, understanding your local tech market salaries will help you in negotiating pay and benefits. 

The [median annual wage](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm) for computer and information technology occupations was $84,580 in May 2017, which was higher than the median annual wage for all occupations. However, there is a wide range of salaries that vary based on location, experience level, job title, knowledge, additional work experience, etc. 

You can gain more insight on the specific salary for your desired job title and location, by searching databases such as [Glassdoor.com](http://glassdoor.com), [Linkedin Salary Guide](https://www.linkedin.com/salary/), and [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/). 

## Exploring jobs, companies, and industries

**What jobs can you expect after completing our program?** 

While there are numerous job titles, here’s what our Web Development grads are now proudly called:

- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Python Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Data Architect
- Business Analyst

**Exploring Companies** 

You’re more than likely familiar with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Apple, but there are so many companies and jobs that often get overlooked by new techies entering the field. We want to help you find those untapped opportunities and grow your list of potential companies to work for. Before you start exploring, think about your personal work needs and values. Do you prefer a large corporation? Perhaps you thrive better working on a small team. Startups, Fortune 500 companies, medium agencies. What does your target company look like? 

One of your assignments at the end of this checkpoint will be to start a list of companies that might be a good fit for you. This is to help you become familiarized with companies that are hiring in your area and to practice researching organizations that are ideal for you. Some of our most successful grads continued to grow their list of potential companies throughout their time in the course. We highly advise that you do the same so that by the time you are ready to start applying, you’ll already have a great leads list. Here are a few best practices for generating your companies of interest. Search Google for lists of jobs by location, industry, and general affinity groups then work your way to more specific wants/needs. Think of what kind of company or industry you want and search for. 

**Search for lists, such as:**

- Best companies for women in (your location)
- Best Places for data scientists to work
- Top startups in (your location)
- Best Fortune 500 tech companies to work for 

**You can also familiarize yourself with companies organically in the following ways:**

- Meeting people in-person and asking them where they work
- Checking companies and brands that you already follow on social media and searching products and apps that you personally use. For example, if you are an avid cyclist, you probably have a bike, a helmet, cycling attire, a quality water bottle, a navigation system, and headphones. There’s a company and more than likely a website, app, and data collection method associated each of those products. 
- Finding competitors of companies that you’re interested in

**Exploring Industries**

Just because you are transitioning into a new tech career, doesn’t necessarily mean that the company you work for will be in the tech industry. Most products or services, regardless of the industry, will need to make a few technical hires from time to time.  

Understanding and choosing an industry is helpful for shaping your long-term career goals. Once you understand what industries interest you, you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the industry, find companies that fall in that category, understand the trends of the industry, and learn who to network with. Here’s a great [Github repository of additional industry verticals](https://gist.github.com/mbejda/19012b99a12e9d014389) for your review.

**Exploring Industries Best Practice:** Leverage your previous experience. Use your knowledge from the industries you’ve previously worked in. Highlight your new tech skills along with your knowledge of that industry’s practices. It will be less of a learning curve for you to learn the inner-workings of that field.

## Staying Abreast of Industry Trends and News

Knowledge and proactivity are key to understanding your new industry. With the world at our fingertips, it’s easier than ever to stay abreast of overall industry standards. As you grow in your new field, you’ll want to keep a pulse on what’s happening in the world of technology. Here are a few ways to stay in the know: 

1. Pay attention to industry thought-leaders who speak about trends before they become trends. Follow their blogs, tweets, websites, and what they say in the news. 
2. Pro-tip: Some of our most successful graduates have taken the extra step to reach out directly to industry thought leader (either local and national) to conduct informational interviews. We’ll touch on how exactly to do this in careers module 2.3, *Networking: Conducting an Informational Interview*.
3. Pick a few blogs, websites, podcasts, or publications to check out periodically. Check out our ever-growing [Tech Industry Media Resources List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfK2M3fCUzgBKpMD9fFIbkecpAPx3sMk-lUTm4xAfaE/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Talk to industry practitioners. Talk to other data scientists about new technologies, languages, and practices.

## Assignment

1. **Visualization exercise:** This is a self-reflective exercise that only requires you to close your eyes and think. We want you to picture your life 2 years in the future as you are working in your new tech field. Take about 5 minutes to really visualize what you want your day to look like at every point, from the time you need to wake up, the type of clothes and commute you want to have, all the way to imagining your ideal work environment. What kind of projects are you working on? What are your team dynamics?  There are no “wrong” visualizations, only yours. 
2. **Make a copy of the** [Careers -  Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkV-ERLv6g3C8vFe8u9HdRye2Kr62O0dOO438nUF2rs/edit?usp=sharing) **document.** You will continue to add to this list throughout the careers curriculum and eventually share it with your designated career coach. Bookmark your saved copy for easy access.
3. **Find 3 job descriptions** that you believe you would be a good fit for at the end of your course. Paste the job title and links to these descriptions in your [Careers - Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkV-ERLv6g3C8vFe8u9HdRye2Kr62O0dOO438nUF2rs/edit?usp=sharing) document. (Since many job postings expire, we recommend pasting the content into a separate document you can refer to in the future.)
4. **Subscribe to at least 3 industry newsletters, podcasts, publications, or blogs**. Refer back to our [Tech Industry Media Resources List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfK2M3fCUzgBKpMD9fFIbkecpAPx3sMk-lUTm4xAfaE/edit?usp=sharing) to find three that you will enjoy. Add the links to your [Careers - Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkV-ERLv6g3C8vFe8u9HdRye2Kr62O0dOO438nUF2rs/edit?usp=sharing) document in the resources tab.
