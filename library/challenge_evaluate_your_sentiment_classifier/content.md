It's time to revisit your classifier from the previous assignment. Using the evaluation techniques we've covered here, look at your classifier's performance in more detail. Then go back and iterate by engineering new features, removing poor features, or tuning parameters. Repeat this process until you have five different versions of your classifier. Once you've iterated, answer these questions to compare the performance of each:

* Do any of your classifiers seem to overfit?
* Which seem to perform the best? Why?
* Which features seemed to be most impactful to performance?

Write up your iterations and answers to the above questions in a few pages. Submit a link below and go over it with your mentor to see if they have any other ideas on how you could improve your classifier's performance.
