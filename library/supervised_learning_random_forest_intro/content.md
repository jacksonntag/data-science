In this module we'll introduce some of the most common and powerful models of supervised learning: the Decision Tree and the Random Forest. Random Forest will be your first example of an ensemble model, a new modeling technique we'll return to throughout the course. Specifically, in this section we'll cover:

 * Decision Trees
 * Entropy in modeling
 * Random Forests
 * Ensemble models
 * The ID3 Algorithm for making a decision tree

When you're ready, let's get started with decision trees.
