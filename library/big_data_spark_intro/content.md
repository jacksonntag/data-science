How is it that companies like Google and Facebook have become two of the most valuable in the world when they ostensibly offer their products for free? Big data is an integral part of the answer. In 2012, Facebook reported that it processed over 500 terabytes of data _every day_, and that number has only grown over time. By analyzing this enormous amount of data, Facebook has become an incredibly effective and profitable advertising platform.

Social media and marketing aren't the only industries that benefit from using big data. The finance, education, government, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors are all at the forefront of big data analytics as well. And the use of big data will continue to permeate every industry.

In this module, you'll learn to answer research questions using Spark with large datasets. First, we'll go over what big data is, why it matters, and the role Spark plays in working with it. Then, you'll set up a local Spark instance using Docker. Once you're up and running, we'll walk you through examples of using Spark in batch and streaming mode. This lesson ends with a challenge where you'll Spark to analyze streaming data from the Twitter API in real time.
