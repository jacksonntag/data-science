For this challenge, you will need to choose a corpus of data from nltk or another source that includes categories you can predict and create an analysis pipeline that includes the following steps:

 1. Data cleaning / processing / language parsing
 2. Create features using two different NLP methods: For example, BoW vs tf-idf.
 3. Use the features to fit supervised learning models for each feature set to predict the category outcomes.
 4. Assess your models using cross-validation and determine whether one model performed better.
 5. Pick one of the models and try to increase accuracy by at least 5 percentage points.

Write up your report in a Jupyter notebook. Be sure to explicitly justify the choices you make throughout, and submit it below.
