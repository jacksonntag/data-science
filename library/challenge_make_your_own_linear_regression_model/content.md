Now that you've spent some time playing with a sample multivariate linear regression model, it's time to make your own.

You've already gotten started by prepping the [FBI:UCR Crime dataset](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-8/table-8-state-cuts/table_8_offenses_known_to_law_enforcement_new_york_by_city_2013.xls) ([Thinkful mirror](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thinkful-Ed/data-201-resources/master/New_York_offenses/NEW_YORK-Offenses_Known_to_Law_Enforcement_by_City_2013%20-%2013tbl8ny.csv)) in a previous checkpoint.

Using this data, build a regression model to predict property crimes. You can use the features you prepared in the previous assignment, new features of your own choosing, or a combination.  The goal here is prediction rather than understanding mechanisms, so the focus is on creating a model that explains a lot of variance.

Submit a notebook with your model and a brief writeup of your feature engineering and selection process to submit and review with your mentor.
