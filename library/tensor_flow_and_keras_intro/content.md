So, you've chosen TensorFlow and Keras. Those previous neural network lessons just weren't enough for you, huh? Maybe they whetted your appetite for just a bit more? Maybe you came into this wanting to learn these tools? Maybe deep learning could be a deep-rooted interest?

Whatever your reason, here you are, and now you will delve a little deeper into these topics. As though you haven't heard this enough, this is going to just scratch the surface of TensorFlow and Keras. Rather than theory, this section will focus on some of the most powerful tools available to implement neural networks. Note, however, that in order to cover these tools we will also cover more about neural networks as a concept.

So what are you waiting for? Let's go!
