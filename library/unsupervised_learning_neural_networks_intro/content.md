Neural Networks are one of the most popular and impactful branches of machine learning today. This is the very bleeding edge of data science, but it has historical roots. In this module we'll explore:

- The perceptron model
- Multi-level perceptrons and neural network structure
- How to use Neural Networks for supervised and unsupervised learning

This will be just the beginning of neural networks, and we'll add resources to go deeper along the way.
