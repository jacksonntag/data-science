Remember regression?  The humble equation y = α + β<sub>1</sub>x turns out to be quite versatile. In this module we'll introduce some new forms of regression, explaining how they differ from the multivariate linear regression you've already met. Specifically, in this module we'll cover:

 * Regression with binary outcomes
 * Optimization methods beyond Least Squares
 * Feature selection methods for regression

Let's get started.
