## Overview and Purpose

You’ve made new friends both at events and online, and they’re open to chatting. Now what? This checkpoint will dive into what it looks like to conduct an “informational interview” to follow up from outreach/a new friendship and build a stronger connection. 

## Objectives

At the end of this checkpoint you will:

- Understand the benefits of informational interviewing
- How to schedule an informational interview
- Get equipped with strong questions for the conversation

## What is an Informational Interview?

An informational interview means that you’re chatting with someone at a company that you’d like to work for one day, and learning about who they are and how you can break into their company as a new hire! 

## Why is it Valuable?

**Fast Track to an Interview**

The ideal goal is that you would be able to **fast track** your way into a job, simply by knowing someone on the team and having an insider rooting for you. The key term here though is “ideal”. 

Here’s what a “traditional” application process can look like: 

1. **Online Application:** You submit your application online through a job posting.
2. **Resume Review:** Recruiter looks through stacks of resumes (including portfolio, but oftentimes they may not be familiar with identifying strong portfolios since they are not technical themselves).
3. **Phone Screen:** If your resume stands out, the recruiter reaches out to you for a phone screen.
4. **Technical Round:** If you pass the phone screen, the recruiter sends you a take-home or timed coding challenge to complete to prove your technical skills. 
5. **Hiring Manager Review:** If you pass the take-home or timed coding challenge, your resume gets sent to the hiring manager.
6. **Final Round:** If the hiring manager is interested in your resume and the results of your challenge, the recruiter will set up a final round interview for you and the team.
7. **Offer:** If you pass all of the above, you go to offer stages. 

Here’s what networking into a job through an informational interview can look like:

1. **Intro/Resume Review:** You know the hiring manager and send them your resume directly, expressing an interest in joining their team.
2. **Technical Round:** The hiring manager gives you a technical take home.
3. **Final Round:** The hiring manager schedules a final interview with you and the team.
4. **Offer:** If you pass all of the above, you go to offer stages. 

**Other Amazing Benefits**

While an informational interview may aim to break into that company, the conversation might end up leading to another end result if that company and that person that you get to know, are simply not hiring now or in the near future. 

*And that is okay!* 

Informational interviews can **still** be beneficial to you in giving you:

- **More insight on the industry:** No matter what, you as a newer member of this industry will need to know what the job is like on the day-to-day, and have a more mature understanding of how to apply your skills on the job beyond this program.
- **Access to a possible industry mentor:** Even if this person cannot hire you, perhaps they can pair program with you one day or give you strong insight on your job search from an industry expert’s perspective? Even if you have mentorship already through this program, it’s always helpful to have more! 
- **Introductions to more industry folks:** This person that you are chatting with may not be hiring, but can they introduce you to three others in their network that might be hiring? Or perhaps they know of someone else who works at a hot tech company, who can become a resource for an internal referral? A strong connection with a mature industry expert will grant you access to a network that would otherwise be hard to tap into. 


## They’re Open to Chatting; Now What?

So you’ve put in the hard work to get your new contact to agree to either a coffee chat or a phone call. Congratulations! Now, you have to work with them to schedule a good time to chat. 

In your follow up email to their “sure, let’s chat”, you should:

- **Thank** them in advance for their time
- **Suggest** three days/times in the next week that they can choose from; **ask** which option works best for them
  - *Don’t do Mon/Wed/Fri 9am; be mindful of providing a variety of options that work around their full-time schedule. Mon 12pm, Wed 5:30pm after work, Friday anytime that they can meet.*
- **Emphasize** your flexibility to accommodate to their schedule for both the day/time and location for their convenience.
  - *Even if the first three options don’t work for them, you can find another time that does. Perhaps you can suggest that you can come to their office or meet somewhere close to there so they don’t have to travel!* 
- **Express** enthusiasm for when the chat does happen

Then, take it from there! As much as possible, aim to schedule something within the next week so that you don’t risk getting forgotten in the mix of their busy schedule coming up. And remember: *It’s on you to take ownership of coordinating all the details of the meeting, and to be flexible to them!* 

## Questions to Ask During the Informational Interview

As mentioned, the informational interview is on you to own and navigate to next steps. So, you should be the one steering the conversation as much as possible! Ideally, you are asking good questions that get your new friend to talk, more than you just talking about yourself the whole time. 

The goal is to learn about them, and their company first! Talk about you second.

When chatting with someone who works on a team that you one day would like to join, here are some solid questions to keep on your mind:


- *What was your journey to getting to this point as a senior level team member? How do you keep your skills sharp beyond a structured school environment? Favorite resources?*
  - You’re letting them tell their story, to get to know them and relate to their learning process, and yours! 
- *What does work/life balance look like for you? Compared to others in the organization (or other jobs you’ve had in your past) how does this job compare?*
  - You’re getting to know them as a human, above and beyond what their day job is. Showing genuine interest in getting to know them as a friend.
- *What was the greatest challenge for you when it came to adapting your technical skills specifically to this team?* 
  - You’re allowing them to talk about specific projects they’ve worked on, thereby learning more about their day-to-day from an insider’s perspective. 
- *How does workflow/projects get managed? Is it distributed per department (each team member serves a specific team always (i.e. department oriented) or is every project distributed across all team members (i.e. task oriented)?*
  - You’re asking a mature question, to get to know the workflow on the job! Showing that you understand beyond school level understanding of the day-to-day. 
- *What is the distribution of senior vs entry-level folks on the team? How long does it take for entry-level folks to ramp up to take on projects (3 months? 6 months?)?*
  - You’re acknowledging that you know how teams are structured and that there needs to be a balance of entry- and senior-level folks. At the same time, you’re vetting out the situation to see if you would have a place on their team one day! 
- *Do you have any advice for me on my job search? Any specific pointers or thoughts on my resume or portfolio? Any good resources for becoming more competitive on the job search coming up?*
  - You’re positioning them in a mentor capacity, and inviting them to speak insight into your situation! 
- *What is the best way to break into your company if I were to apply now or in the future? Insight/tips?*
  - You’re opening up the doors to show interest in joining the team one day and letting the person suggest ideas/ways to do so. 
- *Do you know anyone else in your network who I could also reach out to, for more insight?*
  - You’re tapping into their network for next steps! 
- *I’d love to stay in touch, do you mind if I reach out to you in the future for more questions or another meeting like this?*
  - You’re planting the seed for an ongoing relationship, not just this one conversation. 

Do you notice that there’s a clear structure to the questions above? They’re put in that order so that you can ease your way into navigating the end of the conversation to a solid next step. The key to a strong informational interview is that it equips you with more knowledge, connections, and resources for a stronger job search. 

Of course, depending on time, you can skip over certain questions and whatnot - but the above questions should be a strong guideline that can ensure that your coffee or phone meeting is full of **good** conversation with a genuine connection made between you and the new friend, a lot of key insight/takeaways for you, and an investment in a long-term friendship beyond just this one chat.
