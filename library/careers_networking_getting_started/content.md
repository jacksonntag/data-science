## Overview and Purpose

One of the most important steps in launching a new career is networking. Networking can take many forms such as meet-ups, attending crash courses, chatting on Slack, meeting with your neighbors, or just being social at your favorite lunch spot. But the best networking comes from strategic planning and setting goals for what you want to get out of each networking opportunity. Remember, it’s all in who you know. In this checkpoint, you will better understand the effects of networking and learn how to prepare yourself before diving in.

## Objectives

By the end of this checkpoint, you will:

- Be able to define networking
- Understand the benefits of networking
- Know how to stand out to recruiters & hiring managers beyond your resume
- Learn how to get involved in the tech community
- Overcome common concerns & fears about networking

## What is Networking?

Essentially networking is making genuine connections and building relationships. Or, another more specific meaning is, “interact with other people to exchange information and develop contacts, especially to further one's career.” 

Connections can be a great way to get your foot in the door with a company or team. When you receive a glowing referral from someone the team knows, likes and trusts, your odds of getting an offer to work with that team go up dramatically.

Overall, networking is important for the development of your career. Through proper networking, you can hear about new job opportunities before anyone else, learn new high-demand skills, exchange advice, and even make new friends. Most important, it works; studies show that [more than 70 percent of people land jobs through networking](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2014/09/17/dont-believe-these-8-job-search-myths).

## Benefits of Networking & Visibility

According to the PIE career methodology, your career success is divided into three categories. 

1. Performance accounts for 10% of your success
2. Image accounts for 30%
3. The third factor, Exposure, makes up 60% of your success 

What this means is that your future career success depends a lot on your ability to express your knowledge and skills to others. Of course, you have to perform and be able to do the work in order to find success, but if no one knows why and how you are able to make a contribution, then how will they know to hire you? 

Networking can lead to amazing opportunities. People tend to help those that they know, like, and connect with on a personal level. Building a strong network that you can tap into for career help is something that takes time. That’s why it’s important to start networking as soon as possible. Think about your end goal of getting a job in a new field. You have to start small and work up to building a strong network. This can happen if you set benchmarks to meet new people now and grow those relationships to the point

## **Getting Involved in Your Local Tech Community** 

The more you learn and grow as a new Data Scientist, the more you’ll want to immerse yourself into a larger community of techies. Being visible in your tech community can improve your ability to grow your network, foster opportunities to learn more, expose you to more job leads, and help you feel connected.

**Why is connecting to the tech community important?** 
We’ll start with the PIE career methodology, which is a way to divide your career success into three categories. 

1. **Performance accounts for 10% of your career success**: Performance here literally means the work you do and how well you do it. How do show up in terms of delivering the expectations of your role? 
2. **Image accounts for 30% of your career success**: This is what other people think of you. Do people turn to you for help because you are a problem solver? Do colleagues see you as a positive and creative force in the workplace?
3. **Exposure makes up 60% of your career success**: This represents who you know and who knows you. How many other people know you and appreciate the quality of your work? Do your colleagues know who you are and value your skills? How many stakeholders know about your capabilities, skills, positive attitude and that terrific work ethic?

What this means is that your future career success depends a lot on who you are selling yourself to as well as how often and how well you do the selling. It does not mean that performance and how people view you don’t matter at all, because they do! Of course, you have to perform and be able to do the work, that’s a given. However, if you aren’t able to sell your skills or if you don’t get your name and work in front of people (aka- Exposure), then they will never know what you can do. Networking and connecting with others is your vehicle for exposure.

**Where do the techies in your city go to connect, learn, and network with others in the industry?** 
Whether you connect with others online or in-person, there’s no doubt that networking in tech is one of the most proven ways to land a job. As you transition into your new field, it’s important to build networking into your learning process.

**Online:** Many cities have specific websites or Slack channels that are dedicated to updates on new tech companies or startups. Check out our list of [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qw43Glc1FDwgW1sHRI2941hATmD5ijCYtr6GQyPezE/edit?usp=sharing)[location-specific industry resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qw43Glc1FDwgW1sHRI2941hATmD5ijCYtr6GQyPezE/edit?usp=sharing), a living document that we continuously update. Please let us know if there are other resources in your area that should be added. Connecting on Linkedin 

**In-person local events:** A hackathon, which is a coding marathon where people with technical backgrounds collaborate to build websites, mobile apps, robots, and other software programs. In module 2.1, you’ll learn more about researching local in-person events.

**Regional/National events:** On a larger scale, technical conferences and other big-ticket events are a great one-stop shop to learn about industry trends and to grow your network. Many of these events can be expensive, so our advice is to try to volunteer for an event near you. This way, you get free access to the event and gain exposure. We’ve compiled a list of popular conferences, summits, and seminars that you may want to check out: [Annual Tech Conferences, Summits, & Seminars by month](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UY_kOf0WFEAV_TQD4YsFmCG8oKJRjMegf03PXcT3kNU/edit?usp=sharing).

**Best Practices for Getting Connected:**

- Search [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) & [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) for your location and keywords such as "developer," "tech," "data,” or “design"
- Find hackathons using sites like [HackEvents](https://www.hackevents.co/) and [Hackathon.io](http://www.hackathon.io/events)
- Volunteer at [tech conferences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UY_kOf0WFEAV_TQD4YsFmCG8oKJRjMegf03PXcT3kNU/edit)  to learn more about a specific area and to meet others in your field
- View our [location-specific industry resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qw43Glc1FDwgW1sHRI2941hATmD5ijCYtr6GQyPezE/edit?usp=sharing) to find websites and Slack channels dedicated to tech in your city
- Search [Medium](https://medium.com/) and [DevTo](https://dev.to/t/devto) for pertinent tech articles and blog posts written by real industry professionals
- Search company websites and Linkedin to find individuals with the job title you want one day, check out their background and skills for inspiration. Take it up a notch and reach out to that person.


## Getting Noticed

If a hiring manager’s job is to find candidates, then it’s the candidate’s job to make sure they are found. Sometimes, it’s not only the resume or Linkedin that catches their attention. Many of our grads have found success by putting in just a bit more effort to get noticed on multiple platforms. Here are some action steps that you can take to get noticed even before your job search begins!
 
**Subscribe and Follow:** One of the best ways to connect with others is to follow blogs through [**Medium**](https://medium.com/) as well as other platforms, whether they are tech related and allow you to follow new trends in the market or companies where you could see yourself working. Be sure to follow any local company on Twitter and LinkedIn and be sure to send a direct message if you could see yourself there. It doesn’t hurt to mention why you are following them like relating to their mission and values.

**Connect on Slack:** Start with **(Thinkful/Bloc)** Slack communities which include individuals from all kinds of backgrounds and experience levels as it relates to programming. From tenured, experienced mentors to brand new students, you never know who you’ll meet. From there, branch out to other [tech-specific Slack channels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qw43Glc1FDwgW1sHRI2941hATmD5ijCYtr6GQyPezE/edit#bookmark=id.k2aqr8uksuul). Remember to be active, engage with others, offer help, and follow up. As with other social media platforms, set weekly goals and make it a point to chat with others, help other students get unstuck, look for great resources and celebrate wins!

**Blogging:** This is one of the absolute best ways to get your name out there and get people to start connecting with you quickly.  If you can commit 10-15 minutes per day, a few times per week and start sharing your post on a few other social media sites (like Twitter and LinkedIn), people will begin to find and follow you. Check out how other bootcamp graduates like [Kelley Rose](https://medium.com/@kelleyannerose), [Tom Goldenberg](https://medium.com/startup-founder-panel/my-google-interview-and-lessons-learned-43109881c521), and [Clare Streets](https://blog.schoolofcode.co.uk/learning-code-staying-mum-d0773d620048) created awesome buzz with their posts on Medium!

## Overcoming the fear of networking

If you’re a bit apprehensive about meeting and connecting with new people, you’re not alone. Unfortunately, this necessary evil plagues about 50% of the population.  The good news is that because of this, there have been a ton of articles and books written that are dedicated to the subject.  

Here’s a great article on how to overcome [Networking as an introvert](https://foundr.com/networking-for-introverts/) (5-minute read).

## Assignment

1. Networking mindset exercise: This is a self-reflective exercise that only requires you to think. When you think about connecting with others in your new tech field, what comes to mind? Is this something that you’re excited about? Are you anxious? Are you nervous? Take about 5 - 10 minutes to assess your thoughts and feelings about networking.
2. Identify 3 local networking opportunities you plan to attend and 3 tech professionals in your area you want to connect with. Add them to the [Careers - Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VkV-ERLv6g3C8vFe8u9HdRye2Kr62O0dOO438nUF2rs/edit?usp=sharing) document.
