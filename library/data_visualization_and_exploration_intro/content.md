Creating clear, clean, easy-to-understand visuals is a critical skill.  It plays in all stages of a data scientist's process. In the early stages, visualizations help us get acquainted with a new dataset and identify potential problems.  In the middle stages, visualizations check model results against the data.  And in the final stages, visualizations are key to an effective presentation to stakeholders.

Data cleaning is closely intertwined with data visualization. Good plots help us identify problems in the data that could interfere with getting accurate results. We'll review different types of problems you may encounter and some methods of dealing with problems after you find them.

By the end of this module you should feel comfortable:

 * Plotting data using seaborn
 * Choosing the right plot type to fit your visualization goals
 * Diagnosing 'dirt' in a dataset using research, logic, and visualization
 * Carrying out basic imputation

Have fun!
