# Challenge - Time Series Analysis

Using a different time series data set (either from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) or elsewhere, go about the process of time series modeling. Specifically generate the following things:

* Plot the time series, along with any logical or necessary differences to get a stationary dataset
* Generate and interpret a PACF for the time series (and/or its differences)
* Generate 5 ARIMA specifications and evaluate their efficacy at modeling your data
* Finally choose one specification and make the case for that as a logical model for your dataset.

This should come in the form of a notebook with the necessary prose to explain your process. Remember to use the tools of text, visuals, and analysis to tell a clear and concise story with your data.
