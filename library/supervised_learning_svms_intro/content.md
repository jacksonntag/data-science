In this lesson we'll introduce a powerful classifier and regression technique: support vector machines (SVMs). We'll cover the original classifier implementation as well as how that can be transformed to create a similar model for regression. In this module we'll cover:

 * Support vectors for classification and regression
 * Kernels and the kernel trick
 * Useful extensions of SVM

Support vector machines embody a set of common techniques that will be an essential part of your data science toolbox. Let's get started!
