In this module, we'll get to know the Python data science toolkit — consisting of Python + Jupyter Notebooks + Pandas + SciPy + Numpy + Matplotlib — as we explore how to do basic statistical analysis in the initial exploratory phase of a project.

Here's a breakdown of the topics we'll cover:

- descriptive statistics
- probability
- basic visualizations
- data exploration and evaluation
- data frames
- sampling
- storytelling with data
- distributions

This module ends with your first capstone for this course in which you'll identify a dataset, conduct preliminary analysis, and write a research proposal recommending further work based on your preliminary analysis.
