In this module, we'll explore **supervised learning**, which is one of the main branches of the broader field of **machine learning**. Machine learning deals with discerning models from collections of data in order to do things like make predictions or classifications.

In **supervised learning**, we create mathematical models that get trained to generate to transform a set of input values (aka, feature values) into a set of target variables. We train supervised learning models on past observations of the phenomenon we're interested in. Such models can then be used to make predictions about novel feature values (that is, previously unobserved ones) or just to clarify our understanding of the factors that interact to generate an outcome.

There is a lot of ground to cover in supervised learning. In this module, we'll explore the preliminary steps in any machine learning project: 

* formulating a research question that can be modeled
* data exploration from a modeling perspective
* Creating a wide range of features for potential inclusion in a model
* Choosing which of those features to keep in a model

In the modules that follow, we'll explore different approaches to generating machine learning models based on this initial process.
