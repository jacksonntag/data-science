In this module, we'll introduce a new class of models: similarity models. These are exactly what they sound like: learning through similarity. We'll cover similarity models as an overarching concept as well as their classic example: K-Nearest Neighbors.

Specifically, we'll cover:

* Nearest Neighbors modeling
* Choosing K
* K-Nearest Neighbors for regression and classification

When you're ready to get started, continue on.
