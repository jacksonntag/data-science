Welcome to the data science bootcamp! This module will help you get settled before you embark on the journey to your new career.

If you haven't yet, go back to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/) and schedule your group orientation meeting with student success and your 1-on-1 orientation meeting with your program manager. Also, be sure to schedule your first 1-on-1 session with your mentor, if you haven't already!

Done? Great!

Now, go ahead and read through the rest of the material in this module. We'll walk through the key information you'll need as a reference throughout the program, establish the tools available for you to get help when you need it, and introduce you to Career Services.
