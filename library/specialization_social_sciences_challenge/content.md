Armed with your new skills, go forth and model some data!  Find a repeated measures dataset (possibly using the data sources assignment), generate a hypothesis, and test it.  Your dataset should have at least 5 measurement points per person/group.  You should perform the following steps:

1. Before looking at the data, define your hypothesis
2. Visualize the data
3. Check assumptions
4. Calculate ICC
5. Use likelihood ratio tests to choose a random effects structure
6. Check distribution of residuals and adjust model as needed.
7. Finalize your model and interpret the results in light of your hypothesis

Have fun!
