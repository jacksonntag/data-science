Not all data comes in a ready-to-use form, like a CSV file. Most of the time, data is stored in a database that contains a set of tables with far more information than is actually needed for a single analysis. 

In this module, we'll cover the process of extracting and manipulating data from a database using **SQL**, or "Structured Query Language". SQL is a common language across specific database programs. With SQL, you can select, sort, and manipulate large data sets to support data analysis.

By the end of this module you should be comfortable with:

 * Using SQL statements to query data
 * Simple data aggregation and groupings
 * Joins between multiple data tables
 * CTEs (common table expressions) for advanced querying

Let's get started!
