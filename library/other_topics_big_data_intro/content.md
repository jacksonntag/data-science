Big Data. It’s undoubtedly something you’ve heard before, and depending on what stories you’ve been reading it’s either about dealing with the enormous growth in data recording and storage capabilities that has happened over the past several years or the answer to every problem ever.

It’s not the latter.

As a data scientist you’ll be expected to be able to ‘speak’ big data. This module will give you the skills and understanding to work with ‘Big Data’, as well as know what that really means. We'll be covering architecture at a high level and giving you the language to know how to dig deeper should you run into these situations in the future. 

That said, this will not be an in depth look at implementations, though you should be able to approach those problems with the combination of high level understanding presented here and analogous experience you've already gained elsewhere in the course. Instead, read these checkpoints to get familiar with the concepts and what tools may be useful. We hope you come out of this module seeing how big data is different, and what some of the tools you might encounter in that space are.
