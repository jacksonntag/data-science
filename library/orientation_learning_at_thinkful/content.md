Learning does not have one right approach. The strategies you used in high school or college may not be successful in a remote environment. We’ll provide you with some suggested strategies, but it’s up to you to consider how you learn best and adjust your behavior based on what’s working and what’s not.

## Agile Learning

What is learning? Do we learn in different ways? Can we put a name on the way we learn? What's your learning style? These are questions we are always designing and thinking about, and the answers vary depending on each student. Our job at Thinkful is not only to help you build technical skills but also to help you develop an agile learning mindset. Understanding how you learn is as important as mastering any particular new skill.

Like most adult learners, you probably don't spend much time thinking about your learning style. Agile learning is rooted in the same agile and lean methods of project work that companies use to promote iterative delivery, flexibility, teamwork, and communication. There’s no one “right way” to “do Agile Learning,” but there are a lot of “wrong ways”. The basic recipe for agile learning consists of:

* Early, iterative, and frequent delivery
* Flexibility - welcoming change
* Empowered, collaborative, co-located teams
* A spirit of continuous improvement

The purpose of our learning materials is to provide you with compelling examples and clear explanations of the critical concepts and practices in professional data science. Each assignment illuminates a small number of new ideas, building on what you’ve already learned. You’ll find reading assignments (which mainly explain a concept), walkthroughs (which take you through the steps of implementing a particular feature), and small projects (small deliverables you have to build that force you to use a concept you've learned). Remember, reading alone won't lead to mastery of the material; you need to put concepts into practice by solving problems and building projects where you're not given the solutions.

We strongly encourage you to work through each assignment, giving yourself enough time to carefully read the materials and let the new concepts sink in. It’s better to take twice as long reading deliberately, with full concentration than to get through twice as many assignments with shallow comprehension.

## Reading Strategies 

Using active reading strategies will help you stay on pace and retain information. Successful active reading strategies include fundamental pieces before, during, and after any module:

**Before reading:** Examine the text before reading, completing a project, or moving to the next section. Review text and images; draft questions you’re curious about and address what you already know; set a purpose for the reading.

**During reading:** Pause during the reading of a selection and think about what you read. Visualizing/journaling/annotating; consider connections to the text itself, project, larger tech ecosystem; turn the material into a question that can be answered - then answer it.

**After reading:** Once you have finished reading, it is necessary for you to stop and think about what you read to create a space for reflection. Critical thinking exercises and reflection; write out what questions you still have after the module; can you address the reasons for why you were reading the selection.

### Additional active reading strategies:

* Teach what you have learned to your mentor
* Write a summary of the technologies you learned
* Read each module carefully and then determine “what it says” and “what it does.” Answer “what it says” in only one sentence. 
* Write questions on a google document, and then answer the questions at the end.
* Identify and define any unfamiliar terms to create a personal glossary.
