For this challenge you have two options for how to use neural networks
. Choose one of the following:

 * __Use RBM to perform feature extraction on an image-based dataset that you find or create__. If you go this route, present the features you extract and explain why this is a useful feature extraction method in the context you’re operating in. DO NOT USE either the [MNIST digit recognition database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) or the [iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). They’ve been worked on in very public ways very very many times and the code is easily available. (However, that code could be a useful resource to refer to). _OR_,

 * __Create a multi-layer perceptron neural network model to predict on a labeled dataset of your choosing__. Compare this model to either a boosted tree or a random forest model and describe the relative tradeoffs between complexity and accuracy. Be sure to vary the hyperparameters of your MLP!

Once you've chosen which option you prefer, get to modeling and submit your work below.
