Now, you’re going to complete a technical take home and conduct a final interview to prepare for graduation.

First we’re going to do a technical take home exercise. You can schedule that by reaching out to your PM at any time. You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise so schedule for a time when you have the space to give the exercise the time it requires.

Secondly we’re going to do an interview covering your capstone. This will probe both what you did and the techniques you used to do it, using the presentation and notebook as the guiding materials. You can schedule that via your dashboard after doing your presentation and submitting your notebook. Everything from the course is free game in this interview, and make sure to schedule it at least a week in advance so you have time to complete the take home.
