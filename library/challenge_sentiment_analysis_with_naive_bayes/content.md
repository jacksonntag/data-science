Now that you've spent some time tinkering with an example Naive Bayes Classifier, it's time to build your own.

We've mentioned that Naive Bayes is particularly good for text classification problems. Before we made a spam filter. Now we'll perform a sentiment analysis, classifying whether feedback left on a website is either positive or negative.

Again the UCI Machine Learning database has a nice labeled [dataset of sentiment labelled sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences) for us to use. This dataset was created for the paper [_From Group to Individual Labels using Deep Features_](http://mdenil.com/media/papers/2015-deep-multi-instance-learning.pdf), Kotzias et. al., KDD 2015.

Pick one of the company data files and build your own classifier. When you're satisfied with its performance (at this point just using the accuracy measure shown in the example), test it on one of the other datasets to see how well these kinds of classifiers translate from one context to another.

Include your model and a brief writeup of your feature engineering and selection process to submit and review with your mentor.
