The rise of Google is evidence of the power and utility of teaching computers to 'understand' human verbal communication. This topic, called _natural language processing_ or "NLP", is a lively field that is more closely married to academic research than many other areas of data science. The practical result of this is that there is a lot of information online about NLP, but not all of it can be understood by the ordinary mortal! In this lesson we'll give you the starting tools to do basic NLP, including:

 * Knowing what kinds of information can be extracted from text
 * Being able to convert text to numbers using bag-of-words and tf-idf
 * Applying supervised and unsupervised models to text, including latent semantic analysis
 * Unsupervised neural networks for NLP through word2vec
 * Text summarization
 * Topic extraction
