## Overview and Purpose

The ability to effectively answer behavioral interview questions is a neglected skill among many people in their job search. This checkpoint will go over the typical process as well as explain the purpose of behavioral interview questions, best practices for preparing and answering these questions, and common mistakes to avoid.

## Objectives

- Understand the purpose and goal of behavioral interview questions
- Understand common behavioral interview questions
- Understand how to prepare for a behavioral interview
- Be able to use the STAR technique to create effective interview answers
- Be aware of common mistakes that interviewees make and how to avoid them

**Here's a quick overview of the process a typical tech company will go through:** 

1. Phone Screen
2. Technical Interview (on-site)
3. Take-Home Challenge
4. Fit Interviews (followup)
5. Job Offer
6. Offer Negotiation
7. Offer Acceptance
  

*Obviously, this will differ somewhat by company.*

## Effective Behavioral Interviewing

If you’ve ever been in a job interview, you’ve probably been asked a question that starts with “Tell me about a time when…”. This type of question is part of a “behavioral interview.” Behavioral interviews are used to evaluate both technical and non-technical skills. Many developers, for example, focus most of their interview prep energy on cramming JS trivia or solving coding problems. While these pursuits are valuable, if you don’t excel at behavioral interviews, you’ll never get past the first phone screen.

Most behavioral interview questions focus on a few key topics: your work experience, your work style, and how you deal with obstacles. Recruiters and hiring managers ask these questions so that they can determine if you have the skills and experience that they are looking for, if you can work well with others, if you have the necessary communication skills, and what you do when faced with a conflict or setback.

It’s important to keep the reason why interviewers ask these questions in the front of your mind as you are framing your answers as many of these questions can feel open-ended. Especially questions like “Tell me about yourself.” As you are preparing to answer this question, take a moment to think “What does this person really want to know about me? How can I frame my background in terms of this role that I’m applying for?” The person asking this question doesn’t want to know your entire life story. They want to know how your past experiences led you to be the right person for their role. Similarly, if you are asked to talk about a time you had a conflict with a colleague and how you resolved it, this isn’t your chance to dish about how Mark from Accounting ate all of the snacks in the breakroom, how dare he! Your interviewer wants to know that you have the tact and communication skills necessary to successfully and amicably resolve an interpersonal conflict at work so make sure your answer is focused on this.

**Preparing for a Behavioral Interview or Initial Phone Screen**

To prepare for a behavioral interview, spend time on the website of the company you are interviewing for. Try to learn as much as you can about them. What do they build? What tech do they use? What’s their culture like? Has their CEO written anything about the company? Putting in the time to learn about a company demonstrates that you are serious about this role and will also help you to frame your answers more effectively. Take a moment to go on Glassdoor to see if other people who’ve interviewed there have written anything about their interview experience or the questions they were asked.

In an initial phone screen, you will probably have 15-20 minutes to make an impression. If your answers aren’t concise and polished, don’t expect to make it to the next round. Prepare your answers to the following questions before the interview and practice them. DO NOT try to answer them off the cuff as your answers will be rambly and imprecise.

Here are some common questions to get in an initial interview. Prepare brief yet thoughtful answers to each of these questions. Write out your ideas using the STAR method. Record yourself and listen back to your answers. If you neglect to prepare, it will show so don’t skimp on this important step. As cliche as it is, it’s true that you’ve only got one chance to make a first impression.


- Tell me about yourself.
- Why are you interested in programming?
- What interests you in this role?
- Why do you want to work for this company?
- Tell me about one of your accomplishments.
- Tell me about a project you’ve done that you are proud of.
- Tell me about a challenge you overcame.
- Tell me about a time that you had a conflict with a colleague.
- What’s the most important thing you learned at Thinkful/Bloc?
- What unique qualities do you bring to this team?
- What’s your biggest weakness?
- What’s important to you when thinking about where you work?
- Where do you see yourself in five years?
  

Make sure to come prepared with 2-3 questions to ask about the company, role, team, etc. **Under no circumstances should you ask zero questions.** Some examples of good questions are things like:

- What are the most important qualities to bring to this role?
- What's the biggest challenge that the team/company is facing right now?
- How is success measured for this role?
- What is your favorite thing about working there? (people love answering this one)

Note: Some initial interviews will be extremely short (they just want to confirm you are human) so don’t be surprised to have some conversations that last only 5 minutes.

## Ways People Screw Up Behavioral Interviews

Now that you have an idea of what to expect in a behavioral interview. Here are some common things that people do wrong and how you can avoid them.

**Vague Answers:** When people don’t think about their answers ahead of time, they often have trouble remembering specific details. This makes their answers a lot less impressive. You can avoid this by taking time to think about your responses and write them down using the STAR method (see checkpoint 3 in this module: Crafting Stories).

**Blanking:** Similar to above, when you don’t spend time coming up with answers to these questions in advance, you are gambling on remembering a great example in the moment. If you put yourself in that situation, you are running the risk of completely forgetting any examples. Imagine how it looks if you are asked “Tell me about a time when you overcame an obstacle,” and you respond “I can’t think of anything right now.” It happens to people more often than you’d think and it’s really hard to recover from.

**Rambling, Overly-Long Answers:** Some people get really excited about their examples and want to tell every detail. This eats up valuable time in the interview and can also make you seem to lack self-awareness. You can avoid this by using the STAR method to prepare your answers and then either recording your answers and listening to them or practicing with someone else. As a general rule, each answer should take less than 90 seconds.

**Excessive Verbal Tics and Filler Words:** We all have verbal tics that we unconsciously use when we are searching for the right word, unsure of what to say, or nervous (“Like”, “So”, “Um”, “Sorry”, etc). But excessive use of these filler words can be very off-putting in an interview, especially on the phone when your verbal communication is the only thing that the interviewer has to go on. It can make you sound unprofessional, unconfident, or like you don’t have a good understanding of what you are saying. As uncomfortable as it is, recording yourself and then listening for how often and when you use these words is the best way to be aware of your verbal tics. Only then can you make progress in reducing the amount that you use.

**Underestimating the Importance of Politeness:** In our modern world of brevity and casual convenience, conversational niceties can be an afterthought for many people. You should know that, while it seems small, a lack of politeness can make or break your success in an interview. This is not an exaggeration. Don’t let something that is this easy to avoid hurt your career prospects. Make sure to start every email by asking about the person (“How are you?”, “I hope you are well”). Always thank the person emailing you or interviewing you for their time. Triple-check the name of who you are emailing or talking with to make sure you are spelling it or pronouncing it correctly (This [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThePronounceNames) is one of many that can help you learn to pronounce a name you aren’t familiar with). When you are in an interview, make sure to take a moment to make small talk with the interviewer. Ask about their day, what they did over the past weekend, if they had a chance to get lunch yet, their plans for the upcoming holiday, summer vacation plans, etc. The more you can get this person to feel comfortable and to enjoy talking to you, the more likely they will leave the interview with a good impression of you.

## Using the STAR Technique in Interviews

The STAR technique is what most interviewers use when reviewing your answers for behavioral questions. This helps them make sure that you are touching upon the most important aspects of your response and clearly identified the nature of their question and responded with a well thought out answer.
As we discussed in the other checkpoints, behavioral interviews may include questions like:

- “Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond expectations in your position?”
- “How do you handle a disagreement with a coworker?”
- “Have you ever had to deal with a disgruntled client? How did you handle that situation?”

By using the STAR technique, interviewers are able to see if you clearly described the situation, explained what tasks you were assigned, what actions you took to and what results that brought you.

**How can you use the STAR technique to your benefit?**

During the interview process, you can use the STAR technique to your advantage to provide thorough answers to any behavioral question you are asked. These will make up the components of your personal story, which you can prepare ahead of time to share with the interviewer. These answers normally take about one to three minutes to answer, so let’s dive into the four different concepts you will be using to answer behavioral questions.

**Situation:** You will want to set the scene for your response. Start out by providing context and background to the situation you want to share. If you asked a question about teamwork experiences, your reply will need to include details about what you were working on, who you were working with, when it happened and where you were. For example, “I was working with a team of five people in a marketing firm, working with a new client who wanted to improve their online presence and get more website traffic.” Be as specific as possible.

**Task:** Describe specifically what your responsibility/role was in the situation. “I was tasked with working with the contracted designer to help with the designs and make sure we were reaching a wider audience.” Focus on your personal tasks and what you were working on instead of the referencing the entire team.

**Action:** You will then describe how you completed your task. This is the most important part of the STAR technique because you will be able to highlight what your response was. Remember to focus on what you specifically did, not what the team was working on. Take this opportunity to showcase how you possess the necessary skills the interviewer is looking for. “Working with the designer, I was able to get their website updated with better UX/UI and updated their mobile site on iOS and Android, to reach a wider market of users.”

**Result:** Finally, you want to explain the results that came out of your situation. It should be positive and ideally, quantifiable. You will also want to share any lessons that you learned from the situation or anything that you would do differently the next time you were faced with a similar situation. “Within the first month, we increased their overall user traffic by 33% and it increased week-over-week by 5% for the remainder of the quarter.”

**Creating your Personal Story/STAR Technique In Action** 

The basis of the STAR technique can help you shape better responses to behavioral interview questions, but you can also use this method to work on a very key component of your networking experience: your personal story.

Your personal story tells others (interviewers, networking opportunities, colleagues, etc) how you got this point in your life without actually telling your entire life story! It is an excellent tool to have when meeting new people or going through an interview. You can use the STAR technique to help you craft your story by touching upon each section and building your response.

For example, you are at a networking event and a recruiter from a company that you are very interested in working with asks you:

*What inspired you to pursue web development/design?*

First, **set the stage** for your response: 

>Two years ago, I was on the customer success team with a tech company that specializes in an iOS app. It was a mid-sized team that handled 300 tickets per day. With so much exposure to our customers, I realized there was a serious disconnect with our customer base and our product team, so I started working as Product liaison to bridge that gap. The more I became involved with helping our Product team, the more I realized that I wanted to move into the development side of our company and help enhance our product.

Next, talk about what **task** you took on: 

>I started small, teaching myself to code with a few different coding websites to see if frontend development was something I was interested in. After six months of working on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as JQuery by myself, I enrolled in an apprenticeship to learn both front and backend web development and build up my portfolio.”

Next, talk about the **actions** you took to make sure that you highlight what you did on the team and how you were able to reach your goals. 

>I completed two different projects, one is a media player very similar to Spotify in its functionality and freelanced a webpage for a non-profit located in Seattle. I am currently working on another freelance opportunity with a small start-up in Austin.

And finally, wrap up your personal story with the “**result**”. 

>After working with both companies, I have learned how to implement client requests in an attractive and functional way with my coding skills. I learned a lot more about JavaScript throughout the process and I am constantly looking to improve my skills with more experiences."

## Interview Preparation

**Step 1:** Go over the questions above and review which ones you’d like to answer. Which ones do you hope aren’t asked? Focus on those.
**Step 2**: Think about your projects thus far and what challenges and success you’ve have encountered.
**Step 3:** Write out a success and challenge for two of your projects.
