You now know two kinds of regression and two kinds of classifier. So let's use that to compare models!

Comparing models is something data scientists do _all the time_. There's very rarely just one model that would be possible to run for a given situation, so learning to choose the best one is very important.

Here let's work on regression. Find a data set and build a KNN Regression and an OLS regression. Compare the two. How similar are they? Do they miss in different ways?

Create a Jupyter notebook with your models. At the end in a markdown cell write a few paragraphs to describe the models' behaviors and why you favor one model or the other. Try to determine whether there is a situation where you would change your mind, or whether one is unambiguously better than the other. Lastly, try to note what it is about the _data_ that causes the better model to outperform the weaker model. Submit a link to your notebook below.
