We're now going to spend some time explicitly talking about algorithms and data structures. We've already introduced these ideas throughout the course, with things such as the machine learning techniques we've used or the data structures we've put data into (like lists, dictionaries, arrays, data frames and so on), but now we're going to cover them in a more formal and rudimentary fashion.

Instead of focusing on the most sophisticated algorithms we can implement or the most complex data structures we can use, we're going to break these concepts down to their core, with two specific goals in mind.

Firstly, understanding these essentials will make you a better data scientist. It will help you understand the tools we've already started using and how to use them in the most efficient way. Secondly, algorithms and data structures are a core and frequent topic of a lot of data science interviews. Data structures and algorithms are rightly considered part of the backbone of programming, so employers frequently like to see how well you understand these fundamentals.

You should come out of this lesson better understanding of, and able to answer interview question on, a few key topics:

* The differences between lists, linked lists, stacks, and queues and their relative efficiencies with fundamental operations like adding and removing terms
* What is a fundamental step and how does that relate to "Big O" notation
* How to program a few variations of a rudimentary sorting algorithms
* Why and how to use tree based data structures

As a note before we get started, this is a notoriously difficult subject, and plenty of data scientists working in the field are not masters of these topics. However, being exposed to these topics will make you a better and more efficient data scientist. Don't be surprised if it feels more abstract than a lot of what we've covered thus far, and remember you can always ask your mentor any questions you run into.

Let's get started!
