Programming, or solving problems with code, is a key prerequisite skill for data scientists. In this module, you'll learn the fundamentals of programming in Python and take your first steps in using Python to solve problems with data.

Mastering the topics covered in this module will give you the foundation in programming that you'll need to use sophisticated data science tools and tackle more advanced programming challenges later on.

###### You may already be familiar with programming and the specific topics covered in this module. If so, you're welcome to move quickly through the material and focus your time on newer topics, but please read and complete each of the drills and deliverable projects along the way to confirm for yourself, and for your mentor, that you aren't leaving any holes in your knowledge.
