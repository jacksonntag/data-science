## Overview

Making new connections and tapping into your local tech scene is huge when it comes to investing in your job search ahead of time. The more folks you know, the more help you’ll have on your future search through internal referrals, industry level insight, or introductions to others in their own networks. To get there, however, you have to put in the work to network early and often! This checkpoint will walk you through how to successfully network at in-person events. 

## Objectives

At the end of this checkpoint, you will learn how to:

- Research and plan to attend Meetups and events local to you
- Set networking goals prior to attending events
- Connect effectively with people 
- Follow up after meeting a new contact

## Step 1: Researching Events Local to You

**Where to Look**

Fortunately, there are plenty of tools and online networks to help you find events happening right around you.


- [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/): An online platform designed to help folks connect offline. Active tech communities will often cross-post their events on Meetup, which gives you a convenient place to start. Search for events in your city using tech keywords (think, “Python,” “data science,” or even just, “Tech”). Look for study groups, workshops, and presentations where you can meet people who are interested in your new field. Meetups are *usually* free to attend (they typically have good food too!).
- [Facebook Events](https://www.facebook.com/events/): If you’ve already got a Facebook account, it’s easy to navigate events around you. Go to the “Events” page, and use keyword searches to identify events to attend. Facebook is convenient in that it shows up with a timeline of what’s happening today, tomorrow, next week, next month etc. It also lets you know if you have any friends who are interested in the same event!
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/): This is similar to Meetup in that it is a hub for events happening around you.  Their events tend to be more formal and require a ticket. Conferences, hackathons, pitch events or formal speaking engagements will often post on Eventbrite to manage registration. Many of these events will include a fee to attend. 
- **Other Local Online Communities:** If you’re in a major city, it’s likely that there is a local tech community online specifically for your city. For example, Built in LA, Built in Chicago, Built in Colorado, [city-specific Slack groups for tech,](https://medium.com/@thisdotmedia/local-slack-channels-by-region-9ed641910835) etc. Do some research to see if there are any specific groups around you that are dedicated to creating their own ecosystem of events!

**Evaluating Quality Events**

After researching various events and online communities, it’s natural to feel overwhelmed by the choices. Because you have limited time each week to go to events, it’s important to filter your search to high-quality events that will further your goal of building a network. 

Here are some details to pay attention to, that can help you filter your search: 

- **Number of Attendees:** Based on the registration list for previous events, are there enough people registered to attend to make it worth your while? Or, are there so many people that it might make it difficult to create a meaningful connection?
- **Types of Attendees:** Based on the registration list, are there some folks who will be there, who can help you inch closer to a potential employer? Are there valuable connections to be made through this event?
- **Topic of the Event:** Is this event interesting to you? Could you see yourself going more than a few times?
- **Cost:** If the event requires money, is this event really going to be worth the investment? If it’s free, you don’t have to consider this. But if it requires any form of payment (even if it’s a small amount), you want to evaluate the cost to the value it provides you. 
- **Reviews:** Do you know anyone that has attended this event or are there reviews online?

## Step 2: Planning & Setting Goals for the Event

Let’s say you’ve narrowed your list to 1 or 2 events in the next month. Now what? Before you get to the event day itself, you should be proactive about planning how you’re going to maximize networking at these events, by setting goals for yourself to meet at and after each event.

Here are some ways to plan and set your networking goals:

- **Target Connections**: Based off of the attendee list or the event organizer list - who do you want to specifically chat with at some point during the event? 
- **Prepare Tailored Talking Points:** In relation to specific target connections, what do you want the conversation topic to be about? If it’s the CEO of a small startup - what kind of questions do you want to ask to get an interview right away? If it’s a senior level developer at a large tech company - what is the goal of your 5-minute chat with them and how can you be specific in asking about the company they work for? 
- **Do Research on the Event Topic**: As an attendee at an event you don’t want to seem like networking is your only agenda. How are you going to let folks know that you are genuinely interested in the topic of the event? 
- **Plan to Collect Contact Information:** What’s the minimum number of new connections on LinkedIn or email address exchanges that you want to take away from the event? 
- **Set the Tone for Follow-Up:** How many new contacts do you want to engage for a follow-up coffee chat/phone meeting after you meet at the event? How are you going to plant the seed for this kind of follow-up meeting? 
## **Step 3: Connecting at the Event**

Fast forward and you’re about to arrive at the event. It’s natural to feel a bit nervous about striking a conversation with strangers - but here’s the good news: after introducing yourself, you can navigate solid conversations by **asking good questions**. New contacts like to know that you are genuinely interested in getting to know them, so here are some good questions to keep in mind: 

**What do you do?**

- This can lead to, ‘Have you been coding long?’ Or ‘How do like working for Company Y?’
- *It's also great for following up later. If you only get the person’s first name, it will be hard to find them on social media later. Finding out what company they work for or the field of work can make it easier to track down their user-handles later.*

**Have you been coding long?**

- Asking follow-up questions like, “What languages do you use?”, or “what do you like to do when you are not coding?” “Working on any fun projects in X language?”
- *This is where you can mention your experience and ask for great resources or what got them into programming. Ask things about how they keep themselves sharp if they are more tenured than yourself.*

**What do you like to do?**

- This is great to find out more about the person and their interests, tech career aside.
- *This is a fantastic lead**-**in to find out if you have more in common than just what is being presented at the Meetup. Not many people ask this question! It sets you apart from others and shows that you have an interest in that person, not just a quick conversation.*

**MOST IMPORTANT: Can I connect with you on LinkedIn or get your email address to continue our conversation beyond this event?**

- This is where the magic happens. The first conversation at an event is just the beginning; engaging your new contact for a follow-up conversation is when the real friendship begins to blossom. 
- *Make sure though that if you connect with them on LinkedIn, they connect back with you! And also, if you get their email address, **be specific in when you will follow up** so that they can keep their eye out for your message. The ultimate goal is to make sure that this new connection doesn’t die after the event!* 

## Step 4: How to Follow Up Well

So now that you have met new people, be sure to use LinkedIn or email to:

- Follow up as soon as possible
- Remind them of who you are and what you two chatted about when you met
- End with an ask of “Would you have time next week to connect over the phone, or over coffee, to chat more? If so, I’m happy to work around your availability for this and come closer to your office if that’s easier too”. 
- **If, they don’t respond within a week**, respectfully follow up once more. There’s a chance that your message or email got buried in their inbox, so do a reminder follow-up on your original message to give them the benefit of the doubt! 

Remember your original goal of following up and establishing [x] amount of connections from step 2? This is when you put that to action and take ownership of accomplishing that goal with consistent, respectful follow-up outreach. 

## Quick Final Tips

When you are networking, be sure that you are leaving the best impression possible. 

- **Dress for Success:** You don’t need to wear formal attire, but consider who might attend each event. Make sure that you look professional.
- **Pay Attention to Body Language:** Sit up straight with shoulders back and stand tall. This might seem obvious, but this open body language makes you more approachable than if you were to hunch over at the edge of the room. When you hunch over, you can give the impression that you don’t really want to be there and you aren’t looking to socialize.
- **Smile!** This probably feels really redundant but make sure you are approachable and look like you want to be there to check out new technology or engage in great conversation.
- **Recap:** Afterwards, review the event - who you met, what you learned, and your key takeaways. Is there anything that you would change and do differently next time? Did you hit the goals that you set for yourself? Be sure to adjust if you find that your goals were too easy or that you didn’t make the connections you were seeking.
