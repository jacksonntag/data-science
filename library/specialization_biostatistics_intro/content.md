Biostatistics, also known as bioinformatics, combines the modeling techniques of data science with the thought patterns of medical science to understand and predict health and disease.  Most Biostatistics programs have course lists that look surprisingly like this bootcamp, with emphases on cross-validation, prediction, boosting, and working with Big Data.  On the other hand, they also include courses in the scientific method, design of experiments such as clinical trials, and testing hypotheses by building models and interpreting the parameters.  

We will introduce two common biostatistical approaches to data.  The first is meta-analysis, a set of methods for combining the results of many studies to get a better estimate of the true effect of a drug or other phenomenon of interest.  The second, survival analysis, focuses on predicting when an event will occur.  As suggested by the name, the event most often predicted is death, either from disease or old age.  

Letâ€™s get started and see what happens when we apply data science to health data.
