Observed and recorded behavior is the *gold standard* of people prediction.  If you want to know what someone will do, you'll have better predictions if you look at what they've done in the past rather than ask them.  In some situations, however, **self-reported data** (information about people's thoughts and actions provided verbally or in writing by the person themselves) is all we have.  Perhaps the behavior is too sensitive to collect data on directly (sex, hygiene, income), or would be too expensive or slow to study, or you lack the infrastructure or access to the information directly.  In cases like that, we turn to *surveys* â€“ lists of questions that we hope will give us information we can use to understand our sample and predict their behavior.

Surveys have both pros and cons, and there are specific things you can do to get the most out of a survey.  Let's get started!
