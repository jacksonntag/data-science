Python is one of many programming languages. It's popular in part because of its clear, English-like syntax and because of the enormous ecosystem of open source Python tools for almost any aspect of scientific computing. Simply stated, [Python is currently eating other languages' lunch](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2013/11/18/the-homogenization-of-scientific-computing-or-why-python-is-steadily-eating-other-languages-lunch/).

If you're looking for an overview of Python history, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) is a good starting point. We won't cover that history in detail here, but we do want you to understand at a high level what Python is and important parts of Python culture. Part of being literate in a programming language is knowing a bit about its history and culture.

Guido Van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, originally conceived Python in the late 1980's and released version 1.0 in 1994. As you might guess for a programming language named in honor of [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV2ViNJFZC8), the Python community values irreverence and lightheartedness over stuffy formalism. For instance, the Zen of Python, a poem including guiding Python development principles, is built into the Python interpreter and can be accessed with `import this`:

This poem comes from [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). The "PEP", or "Python Enhancement Proposal", process is how the Python language continues to be developed. You can read more about that process in [PEP 1](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/) if you're curious. Another good PEP to be aware of is [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the definitive style guide for Python that describes stylistic conventions adopted by the community. In addition to the nine PEP Editors (including Chris Angelico, @rosuav over in [Slack](https://thinkful.slack.com/messages/general-discussion/)) Guido retains final say over language development as "Benevolent Dictator For Life".

Each PEP as well as the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/) is hosted on python.org. For the last several years the Python development community has been moving over from Python 2 to Python 3, and this course will use Python 3. We won't cover Python 2 here, but there's still a lot of Python 2 in production so it's good to be aware that it's around. It's also good to be diligent when you're looking at random code samples online and to be sure you aren't accidentally looking at the the old [Python 2 documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/).

In order to write Python code you'll want a text editor, and to run it you'll need a Python environment. We'll get you up and running with both of these on your local machine later on. For now we'll be using these small editors and interpreters embedded in your browser. You can type and run any code you like in these. Give this one a try now:

You can also duplicate, save, and bookmark any of the examples here if you want to keep them around for reference later.

Now that you know a bit about the language let's dive in and start using it.
