And now you’ve come to the last step of your final capstone --- it’s time to present your product.

You can think of this presentation in several different ways. It could be like pitching your product to potential investors. It could be pitching it to a relevant company while interviewing. The key is this presentation should be engaging, informative, and beautifully put together. It should also run approximately 20 minutes, and be technical but product focused. That means while you should explain the machine learning you used, focus more on explaining the product itself, what problem it solves, and why your solution is valuable.

When you’re ready, book a time for your presentation in [your Thinkful dashboard](https://dashboard.thinkful.com/).
