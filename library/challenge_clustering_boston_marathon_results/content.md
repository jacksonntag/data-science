You now have a pretty varied suite of clustering and clustering evaluation methods; we'd be remiss if we didn't give you the opportunity to try them out on some real data. So here we go!

There is a lot of information on [runners and their performance for the Boston Marathon](https://github.com/llimllib/bostonmarathon). Pick a year (post-2012 has more info) and do some clustering.

Specifically, use the tools at hand to determine which clustering solution, including number of clusters and algorithm used, is best for the marathon data. Once you have a solution you like, write a data story, including visualizations, where you teach the reader something about the Boston Marathon based on your clusters. Write up your report, including your process from start to finish, in a Jupyter notebook and submit it below.
