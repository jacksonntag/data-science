## Overview and Purpose

Most students join our program to switch their career to a new field. Switching careers is challenging, and there’s more to it than just having strong technical skills! Throughout the data science bootcamp, you'll start to prepare for your job search by getting to know your local job market and creating an compelling online professional persona. In this checkpoint, we'll give you a picture of how you'll collaborate with the careers team to land your dream job.

## Your New Career

Congratulations! You are well on your way to your new career. That’s a huge step and your continued determination and hard work will be essential to reaching your goal. A successful job search, especially one in a new field, takes a lot of planning and preparation. It’s not something that you can put off until the end of your program and expect to be successful. That’s why we have embedded career prep checkpoints throughout your program. Step-by-step, you will learn and practice everything that goes into a successful job search.

Here’s what to expect to learn from our career prep:

- **Brand Yourself as a data scientist:** You will learn to act like and think about yourself as a data scientist - not as someone who dreams of being one or is an “aspiring data scientist,” for example.
- **Learn How to Network Like a Pro:** You will master the art of networking in all its forms (even if you are an introvert!). You will learn how to present yourself, talk about your experience, and leverage your connections.
- **Make Your Materials Job Search Ready:** You will receive guidance and feedback in creating the most effective job search materials including resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles, and more.
- **Practice** **Technical** **and Non-Technical Interviews:** You will receive training in the latest technical interview techniques and have chances to practice both technical and behavioral interviews with experienced hiring managers.
- **Navigate a Job Offer:** You will receive coaching in how to evaluate and negotiate job offers.

Much of this training will occur while you are still in your program. You will work with both your mentor and the Careers team to make sure that you are on track to successfully land a role once you are job-ready.

After you’ve completed the mentor-led section of the program, you will continue to work with the Careers team to help you execute on a successful search. Remember that we won’t place you in a job or conduct your job search for you. Our job is to help get you ready for a successful search by providing you with resources, guidance, and feedback. You should still expect that your job search will involve a lot of hard work and stretching yourself to go beyond your comfort zone.

So what can you expect from us?

- **Lessons** that take a cumulative approach to building your profile as a technical candidate.
- **Workshops** that are designed to set you up for success as you approach your job search.
- **Weekly career office hours** where you can ask our dedicated career coaches those burning questions.
- Post-graduation access to **1-1 individualized career coaching** as well as **group coaching sessions.**
- **Technical practice** to ensure that you’re ready for any - and all - technical evaluations.
- **Company referrals** to opportunities in our network, when applicable.
  
On your end, we’ll expect you to go through our careers curriculum modules and complete all of our career checkpoints. These checkpoints contain assignments that are needed to ensure that you’re equipped with the necessary job market skills as well as on track for graduation and your tuition guarantee, if applicable.
