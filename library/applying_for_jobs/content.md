## Overview and Purpose

When it comes to job boards, most people know about Indeed, Monster, and LinkedIn. However, there are plenty of other websites as well as other methods of applying for jobs.
 
This checkpoint will explore what that looks like and why you should be incorporating it into your job search. You’ll also learn about local boards and efforts — as well as which newsletters you should sign up for and follow.

## Objectives

At the end of this checkpoint, you will:

- Understand where to look for jobs
- Be able to evaluate which job boards are better for your market
- Understand the steps involved in applying for jobs

Jobs advertised on job boards are low-hanging fruit and the lowest value leads you’ll find, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore them. Set aside some time early in your job search to do a comprehensive job board review, adding interesting positions to your job tracker. Then, during the remainder of your search, do a weekly sweep to surface newly posted jobs to add to the top of your funnel.

The best source for job postings will vary from city to city, but here’s a list of boards to start you out with.

Startup-focused resources:

- [AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs)

**Digital Agency resources:**

- [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com/jobs/)
- [Digital Agency Network](http://digitalagencynetwork.com/jobs/)
- [Top Interactive Agencies](http://www.topinteractiveagencies.com/digital-directory/north-america/united-states/)
  

You can also find city-specific job boards. See the [AIRS 2016 Global Job Board Directory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-3rU60rpClXT09YOElQVzJYNFk/view), a recruiter tool, and run a quick [google search](http://bit.ly/2M69978) to surface more options in your area if you need additional resources.

**Email Newsletters**

Sign up for these email newsletters to get access to jobs and tips:

- [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/index.htm) contains reviews of companies from employees within them.
- [LinkedIn](http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/20709) email alerts for new job postings.
- [Strictly VC](http://www.strictlyvc.com/) is about industry funding announcements, which tell you who is about to go on a hiring binge. Submit resumes to companies who have recently raised.
- [Mattermark](http://mattermark.com/app/Newsletter) is a digest of VC blog posts. Not directly job-relevant but often interesting nonetheless.
- [TechCrunch's Crunchbase newsletter(s)](http://link.crunchbase.com/join/subscribe) contain funding and startup announcements.
  
**Follow the Money: VC Firms**

For a more targeted approach, look at the portfolios of Venture Capital funds. Each of these companies will have its own hiring page. They are all capable of hiring you and the companies are likely interesting to work at. You'll probably source many of your "Bucket 1" opportunities here.

**When targeting startups, the key is to understand the money.**

Startups who have recently raised a round will usually go on a spending spree to pick up developers. We've spoken before about finding the right environment where you can learn best (and startups aren't always it) but, if you'd like to join a startup, make sure it's recently been funded.

There are a lot of companies on Angellist that are pre-funding or who have just completed an accelerator and are desperate for developers. They will offer equity but rarely anything approaching a decent salary and you won't have a senior dev to learn from. Caveat Emptor.
Here are common VC websites which contain their (well funded) portfolio companies:

- [Andreesen Horowitz](http://a16z.com/portfolio/)
- [Benchmark](https://twitter.com/benchmark/lists/current-venture-portfolio)
- [First Round Capital](http://firstround.com/companies#location)
- [Founder collective](http://www.foundercollective.com/collective)
- [Founders Fund](http://ventureloop.com/foundersfund2011/)
- [LowerCase Capital](http://lowercasecapital.com/posse/)
- [Google Ventures](http://www.gv.com/portfolio/)
- [New Enterprise Associates](http://www.nea.com/portfolio)
- [Sequoia](http://jobs.sequoiacap.com/careers_home.php)
- [YCombinator Companies](http://yclist.com/)

**Slack Groups**

In addition to the places above be sure to do a local search for other local channels. One such way is by searching for Slack groups in your area. One example is the NYC Tech Slack group in New York, where you’ll find a #jobs channel. Refer to this document to see what are some popular [groups](https://blog.standuply.com/the-ultimate-list-of-400-slack-communities-2a7f3954f1d3) and if you don’t see something, be sure to look for one! Most major cities have a group. We have also crowd-sourced some groups [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lAzwPrCBWuB56fkRH5275JA3q2rEPHKdiGm7rk2YbD4/edit).
 
## Steps

**Get Connected Now**

- **Step 1:** Go over the general job boards and begin to see how many jobs are posted.
- **Step 2:** Go on Angellist and evaluate if it’s a good tool to utilize during your search.
If so, be sure that you sign up for a profile. It’s very similar to LinkedIn!
- **Step 3:** Locate at least one local Slack group for you to join.
- **Step 4:** Look for a #jobs or #job-seeking or #hiring channel.
    - **Bonus**: Introduce yourself in #general and let people know who you are and what you’re looking for!
- **Step 5:** Review venture funds and locate a recently funded company in your area. Are they hiring?
- **Step 6:** Create email alerts with the right criteria that will be sent out to you on a daily or weekly basis.
- **Step 7:** Set a schedule on how often you’ll check job boards, Slack channels, and other mediums.
- **Step 8:** After you have looked thoroughly, find a role to apply to and locate an employee from there on LinkedIn. You’ll want to reach out to this person so they can help push your application forward. Please refer to our lesson on cold outreach to see what steps you should take while reaching out.

## Assignment

Compile a list of at least 10 roles that you find via various job boards and add them to [your job tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HzpWzZEkkzuaCCnsRzpjTCbza_KQoVfTPGkQA7bh8bg/edit#gid=1154227907). Keep in the mind that you'll be using this tracker during your job search and the hope is that you apply to these roles once we go over job listings. 

Apply to at least two, reach out to someone, and take a screenshot of your application.
