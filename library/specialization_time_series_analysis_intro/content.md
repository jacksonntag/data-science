So, you've chosen to take a journey through time?

Good call.

Time has been lingering around a lot of topics we've covered in the course, on the periphery but rarely taking center stage. In anything we're modeling that happens over some period rather than simultaneously, time likely plays a role. It makes intuitive sense therefore that time should be modeled, but thus far we haven't really emphasized the tools needed to properly deal with that dimension.

Here that changes.

This specialization will cover some of the fundamental ways data scientists can deal with time. We'll cover some theory about processes and a concept called _stochasticity_. Then we'll cover some ways to transform our current tool set, particularly linear modeling, to handle time. Lastly, we'll introduce the classic model for time series analysis, ARMA.

You'll leave this specialization with a better grasp of how to deal with one of the fundamental elements of modeling: time. When you have some, continue on.
