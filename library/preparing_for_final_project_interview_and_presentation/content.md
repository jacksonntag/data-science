You've created your model and a Jupyter notebook that presents your findings. Next up, you'll do a final 1-on-1 interview with an evaluator covering your final project before presenting your final project to the Thinkful data science community.

You'll schedule both of these events from your dashboard after completing this module, but in this checkpoint, we provide some guidance on how to prepare for both.


## Preparing for your final project interview


This 60-minute, 1-on-1 interview focuses on your final capstone project. The interviewer will probe both what you did and the techniques you used to do it.

Be prepared to talk about:

- Your end user and the value your project provides to them
- The technical ins and outs of your model
- How you evaluated the performance of your final model and alternative models you considered
- Your data sources
- Next steps you'd take to expand on your work


## Preparing for your final project presentation

You can think of this presentation in several different ways. It could be like pitching your product to potential investors. It could be pitching it to a relevant company while interviewing. The key is this presentation should be engaging, informative, and beautifully put together. It should also run approximately 20 minutes, and be technical but product focused. That means while you should explain the machine learning you used, focus more on explaining the product itself, what problem it solves, and why your solution is valuable.
