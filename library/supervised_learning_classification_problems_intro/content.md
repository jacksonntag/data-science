You're ready to build your first model. In this module, you'll build your first *classification* model; specifically, a model that uses the Naive Bayes modeling technique to classify email messages as spam or not spam. Here's what we'll cover in this module:

* The difference between classifiers and regressions
* What is a Naive Bayes classifier?
* Choosing between types of Naive Bayes models
* A guided example of how to build this type of model using SciKit Learn.

Let's get started.
