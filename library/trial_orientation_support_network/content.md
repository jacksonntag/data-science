As a trial student, you are part of the Thinkful community, and you’ve got a team of people at Thinkful here to support your progress and success. The goal of each team is to give you the tools and support to get you part of the way, but note that only _you_ can get yourself across the finish line. 

## Your Program Manager

The Program Manager team is here to assist in a variety of ways. First, your program manager will support you with any non-technical issues or questions that you are having. They are here to make sure that you have the information, support, and advice that you need to complete your program. This can be anything from questions about payments to tips on time-management or dealing with anxiety.

Second, your program manager works with you to hold you accountable for your success and help you to get there. You will have regular check-ins opportunities with your program manager throughout the trial period to make sure that you are on track to reach your goals. If you are in one of our local communities, your PM will also coordinate events where you can connect with other Thinkful students. If you haven’t already, you will also have an orientation with your program manager to learn about your personal goals and set you up for success during your trial. 


## Mentors

Our mentors are here to give you technical guidance through your trial experience. You will have the opportunity to meet with mentors through group video sessions, and they will provide you with feedback and advice, help with you unravel particularly tricky concepts, and help you prepare for the technical aspects of your job search.


## Put in the time

Learning takes time and effort, and you should plan accordingly. Doing the bare minimum of work is going to get you the bare minimum of results (and future salary). You need to make sure that you are dedicating undistracted time to learning these concepts and reinforcing the material by reviewing and practicing consistently. For example, in the full Data Science program, putting in 3 hours every day is going to be more effective than cramming 20 hours over the weekend. Put this time on your calendar. Make sure that your friends and family know that you are taking on this challenge and will be less available. And if you feel like you need more time or assistance, we’ve got tips available for you as you move through the trial.

### The 30 minute rule

We can say with 99.99% certainty that you will get stuck at different times during this course. How do we know? Because even professional data scientists regularly get stuck; they happen to be experts in getting unstuck (which is a skill you’ll develop over time). As a newcomer to data science, you’re even more likely to get stuck. When you _do_ get stuck: stop, take a step back, try to articulate the problem first to yourself, and then Google your description of the problem. There’s a good chance that other people have had similar difficulties, and you may find an answer online (especially on Stack Overflow if it involves code). How do you know you're "stuck"? If you haven't made progress in 30 minutes you're stuck.

### Slack

Slack is also a critical resource for getting help as well as chat with students and mentors about everything from the tech industry to the latest episode of Game of Thrones.

Blanche Cohen, a Thinkful mentor, says, "Ask for help as soon as possible. Don't feel awkward or ashamed that you don't get it.” Through Slack, you have access to hundreds of mentors and students who are ready to help. You'll often get a fast response in Slack thanks to the size of this community. If a mentor is helping another student, be patient – it can take 10 or 15 minutes to get help in Slack depending on the time of day.

And remember, everyone in the Slack community was a new student once. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Here are some tips for getting helpful responses:

* Include details about the problem you're encountering.
* Let the community know what you already tried.
* Share a link to your code, whether on GitHub or Gist or some other platform, or share code snippets directly.
* Avoid vague questions like "Can someone help with Pandas?" We find most of the time other people won't speak up because they are afraid they won't be able to help. Ask the whole question, and you’ll get a response more quickly.

The students who are the most successful in our programs are the ones that are the most active in the community. They are on slack sharing ideas, asking for help and giving help. It’s a place to get support, but also a place to challenge yourself to provide support and mentorship to others. When you see a question on Slack, you might know the answer to, jump in and help! Explaining concepts and techniques to someone else is a great way to reinforce your knowledge (ask any of our mentors!).

Our Slack community and local community events are also where you will start to build your professional network. Your next job might come out of it, so it’s crucial to develop those relationships.


### Office Hours

While you are working through your Thinkful curriculum, you are going to have lots of questions and need technical support. Don’t be surprised when that happens! While Slack is excellent, nothing beats facetime with an expert. Office Hour (question & answer) sessions are held every day and can cover everything from front-end and mobile development to data science. If you have a specific question, either from your coursework or even a personal project, visit the calendar and RSVP to the next convenient session. If you feel like seeing what others are up to, feel free to drop in even if you don’t have a specific question.

### Workshops

Workshops are live, lecture-based sessions with a subject matter expert, who provides information on a particular topic. Workshops are designed to supplement the material covered in the curriculum. Usually, workshops will have lectures as well as live demos of examples to provide an in-depth understanding of the topic. You are encouraged to interact with the presenter and ask questions related to the workshop topics.

From your mentor, to slack, to your program manager, to student support, to office hours, you have a lot of support as you work through this program. Even so, you'll have moments of frustration. When you’re feeling challenged, remember why you’re putting in all this work: to land your first job as a data analyst and everything that goes with that.
