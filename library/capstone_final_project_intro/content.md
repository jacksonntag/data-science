This is it. You've reached the end. It's time for one more capstone to really show off everything you've learned over the course. Use this as a chance to review the work you've done so far and push it forward to new levels of relevance and technical achievement. Good luck.

For this Capstone, you will build a model. Extending on the work you pursued in your specialization, go out and build a model.

However, this cannot just be any model. It has to be something we would classify as a "Data Science Product". What do we mean by that?

A data science product is more than just a model. It is a solution. Your final capstone should _solve a real problem_ and _create something of value_. A product that you would argue to implement in production and/or launch.

Great examples of data science products include Netflix's recommendation engine, Zillow's Zestimate tool, or Kayak's 'When to Buy' index. All of these tools use data science to solve a real problem, offering value to users by filling a need. Counterexamples include a program that autonomously beats Super Mario levels or a model that identifies images of cats. [A production-quality mobile app that uses edge computing to identify hotdogs in real time on commodity mobile hardware](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3), however, gets close.

As such this final model has to work, and work well. Spend time tuning it and optimizing it to be the best model you can possibly make. If you do it well, you may even have a startup on your hands.

Before you get started, however, here are a few deliverables, requirements, and guidelines:

Deliverables:
* A one page proposal to be approved by the data science team here, before you begin
* A 20 Minute Presentation on your product that argues not only for its relevance, but why this implementation is best, and the technical tools you will use to get there. This presentation should include a demo!
* A jupyter notebook that builds the model and shows your machine learning tuning process
* Defend your model in a 60 minute mock interview (the interviewer will attend your presentation and read through your notebook beforehand)
* A final 60 minute mock interview on data science generally

Data Science Requirements:
* Utilize at least one specialization in your pipeline
* Include supervised _and_ unsupervised techniques

Guidelines:
* Your data set will be hugely important here. Though we've relied on preaggregated data before, for this assignment gathering your own data through scraping or other techniques may allow you to make a more impactful or novel product. It will likely need to see a continuous flow of data in order to be relevant as a data solution.
* Emphasize why your implementation is the _best_ implementation, not just _an_ implementation
* Remember, a good product is more than just metrics. It solves a problem.
* You do not have to make a front end or a user interface for this product

Each of the deliverables have a separate assignment below to submit or schedule, as well as an expansion of the instructions.
