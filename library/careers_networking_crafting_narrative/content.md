## Overview

A crucial part of networking is knowing the most effective way to present yourself to new contacts and connections. You have limited time within networking events and interviews to be heard and to capture the attention of your listener. Knowing how to sell yourself and having a short, personally crafted pitch will go a long way.


## Objectives

By the end of this checkpoint, you will learn:

- Why you should use an elevator pitch
- How to craft your elevator pitch
- How to address a career change with your pitch


## What is an Elevator Pitch?

An elevator pitch is a short statement or summary of your experience, background and career goals.  The term comes from the idea that a person should be able to deliver the entire pitch within the time frame of a trip on an elevator, therefore, it should only take between 30 seconds and 2 minutes to give. Ultimately, your elevator pitch is used to sell yourself, your skills, your unique selling proposition (USP), and your career goals. This short statement should answer the following questions: 

- Who are you?
- What do you do?
- What skills do you have?
- What makes you different?
- Where do you want to take your career?

## When Will You Use Your Elevator Pitch?

**Meeting or Interviewing With a Target Employer:** Imagine a scenario where you happened meet the hiring manager of your ideal job. You have limited time to make an impression, tell your story, and communicate your desire. Would you be ready? Could you take advantage of the opportunity?

**Networking Events:** Regardless of the type of networking or employer interaction you experience, you should be ready to clearly articulate your strengths and what you can offer. Having a “go-to” statement that highlights where you are and where you are going can lead to unexpected opportunities. Many coincidences happen simply because of the willingness to put yourself out there.

**Baseline for Written Career Documents:** You can also consider your elevator pitch to be the theme of who you are as a professional. You can use the pitch as a baseline for connecting in-person, but also for constructing other career correspondence such as your Linkedin profile summary, resume summary statement, or a cover letter. 


## How to Craft Your Personal Pitch - a Step by Step Guide

**Planning out Your Personal Pitch**
It may feel a bit overwhelming to try and condense your entire educational and career background into one minute, so here is a method to draft out your pitch and find the key information you want to share with future employers and connections.

**Step 1: Make a List**
Start by listing 10 of your most interesting bits of information that you want to share. This is a braindump of information so don’t think too hard. It’s important to just start.

**Step 2: Review Your List** 
Review your list and eliminate any redundancies, unnecessary or unclear information, and broad business jargon (especially with tech). Enhance the good stuff.  For example, “I’m great at coding” isn’t likely to pique anyone’s interest, but “I’ve completed three projects using Node.js and React” sure might. What makes YOU unique? Keep the items and accomplishments that make you stand out to the listener.

**Step 3: Get their attention**
Add an interesting fact to use at the beginning of your speech or reference your career change intentions. Your goal is to immediately engage someone so that he or she is intrigued and wants to learn more.

**Step 4: Compile**
Compile your top 5 interesting bits of information and organize it into your speech, along with your interesting fact. Make sure you are addressing who you are, what you do and why you would be the perfect candidate.

**Step 5: Practice!** 
Once you have your pitch organized, do not forget to practice and record.


## Best Practices for Crafting Your Pitch

**Be Concise:** Remember, you only have about a minute with an "elevator pitch", so stay away from the tendency to ramble or add in too many details. This is your first impression and you want it to stay in the recruiter or contact’s mind when you speak with them. Get to the point and be polite!

**Be Persuasive:** Even though it's a short pitch, your elevator speech should be persuasive enough to spark the listener's interest in your idea, organization, or background. If you sound unsure about your skills, then why would an employer believe it?

**Be Bold:** Ask for a call to action at the end, and don't be shy about steering the conversation a certain way with your pitch! End with a question, a transition statement - whatever it is that will get the listener to respond in a way that you want them to for next steps in the conversation.

**Be Flexible:** You aren’t interviewing for a specific position, so you want to appear open-minded and flexible. It’s your chance to make a great first impression with a potential employer.

**Be Ready (Practice, Practice, Practice!):** The best way to get comfortable with an elevator speech is to practice it until the speed, and “pitch” come naturally, without sounding robotic. You will become comfortable varying the conversation as you practice with it.

**Be Critical:** Ask for constructive feedback with your pitch. Reach out to friends and family. Once you receive feedback and hone your pitch even further, record yourself saying it. Listen to your tone and make sure it is friendly, non-threatening, and that you are not talking too quick (knowing you only have a few moments to speak may subconsciously increase your pace).


## How to Address a Career Change in your Personal Pitch

Many students are looking to make a career change once completing their Thinkful/Bloc training. With that in mind, you may wonder how you can tie in your past experiences to let future employers and connections know that you are looking to make a change.

You still want to start off by addressing “who you are”. For example, if you are an Operations Manager making the change to Data Scientist, let them know right up front.

_“Hi, I’m Christy and I am a Data Scientist with 5 years of experience in nonprofit membership engagement.”_

Expound on your past experiences and achievements, pick out the parts from your previous positions that you want to use to help you with your new position - along with how that tied into your curiosity/interest for data science.

_“In my previous roles, I managed several databases and proactively engaged our m for feedback on how to make our product and our platform better and efficient every quarter. Clients want to feel that their platform is designed for the modern customer and having an eye in design is a great way to attract new users. Being a passionate people person, I loved working with users and hearing them out, but I started to wish I had more skills in knowing how to apply their feedback to product design.”_

Now wrap your pitch with a sentence that ties in your background with your career transition. Be bold and clear about what prompted that decision, and where it led you next:

_“When I began to learn about the field of data science, I realized that it encompassed all of my favorite things about my _________ job. So that’s why I decided to dive right into a career change by building projects and learning cutting-edge technologies with Thinkful’s program. I’m excited to enter into this industry with my new skills and get to work right away!”_

Finally, wrap up with a call to action:

_"Do you have a LinkedIn or a personal email that you'd be open to exchanging with me? I'd love to stay in touch with you to grab coffee and hear more about your journey to data science!"_

OR

_"Do you have any tips or advice for a new data scientist like me? Any best practices on the job search?"_

OR

_"What was your journey like to data science?"_

OR

_"What brought you to this networking event?"_
