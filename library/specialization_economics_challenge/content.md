Now itâ€™s time to go build your own model focused on interpretability.

Go find a data set, recalling the previous lesson on economic data sources. Then, use this data to propose a relationship via a linear model. After suggesting features that are linearly related to an outcome, build a series of linear models to test that relationship. Create a brief write up [1-2 pages] that explains the reasoning for your relationship and the impact of your analysis on your understanding thereof. Your focus should be on interpreting the meaning of the parameters, rather than the predictive power of the model.
